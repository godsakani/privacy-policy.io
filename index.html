        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we
            collect at
            UniEase, how UniEase uses it, and what choices you have.
            The SERVICE is
            provided by
            UniEase at no cost and is intended for use as it is.
            If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection
            and use of
            information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information
            that we collect
            is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or
            share your
            information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in
            our Terms and
            Conditions, which are accessible in our Application unless otherwise
            defined in
            this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you
            to provide
            us with certain personally identifiable information, including but
            not limited
            to the user's name, email address, and phone number. The information
            that we request
            will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.
            The app does use third-party services that may collect information
            used to
            identify you.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
            as an
            anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the
            website
            that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory</p>
        <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the
            app may use
            third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect
            information and to
            improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
            refuse these
            cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
            choose to
            refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this
            Service</p>
        <h2>Device Information</h2>
        <p>We collect information from your device in some cases. The
            information will be
            utilized for the provision of better service and to prevent
            fraudulent acts.
            Additionally, such information will not include that which will
            identify the
            individual user.</p>
        <h2>Service Providers</h2>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the
            following
            reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties
        have access to
        your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
        assigned to them
        on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use
        the
        information for any other purpose.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We value your trust in providing us with your Personal Information,
            thus we are
            striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But
            remember
            that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of
            electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its
            absolute
            security.</p>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
            knowingly
            collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
            In the case
            we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
            information, we
            immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or
            guardian and
            you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
            information, please
            contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.</p>
